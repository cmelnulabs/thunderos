## Development Philosophy

### Principles
- **Quality over speed** - Each release should be stable and well-tested
- **Documentation first** - Every feature should be documented
- **Test-driven** - Automated tests for critical functionality
- **Hardware compatibility** - Work on both QEMU and real boards
- **Educational focus** - Code should be readable and well-commented

### Release Cadence
- **Minor releases (0.x):** Released when features are complete and stable
- **Patch releases (0.x.y):** As needed for bug fixes
- **Major release (1.0):** When foundation is complete and stable

### Contribution Guidelines
See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for details on how to contribute to ThunderOS development.
